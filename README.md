Personal Portfolio

This is a portfolio website made to advertise my skills and projects I've created to people who may potentially wish to hire me.

The website has some basic information regarding my educational background and my programming skills, as well as a section listing the various projects and websites I've worked on. There is also a contact form for those who wish to contact me.
